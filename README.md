## 🔌 Evidence Sources & Network Access

Skills in this repo reach medical evidence two different ways, and the difference
matters a lot in sandboxed environments:

| | MCP connector | Direct REST API |
|---|---|---|
| Route | Server-side | Through the container's egress proxy |
| Blocked by egress policy? | **No** | **Yes**, by default on Claude Code on the web |

On Claude Code on the web, direct calls to `eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`,
`api.crossref.org`, `clinicaltrials.gov`, `api.fda.gov` and friends fail with
`Tunnel connection failed: 403` — the request never leaves the infrastructure.
MCP connectors (PubMed, Clinical Trials, Scite, Consensus, Elicit, Scholar Gateway,
bioRxiv) keep working.

**Check what is reachable before running a lookup skill:**

```bash
python3 scripts/check_evidence_sources.py          # status table for every source
python3 scripts/check_evidence_sources.py pubmed   # one source
python3 scripts/check_evidence_sources.py --json   # machine-readable
```

Exit codes: `0` all reachable · `1` blocked by egress policy · `2` other failure.

**Full health check (works in both environments):**

```bash
python3 scripts/doctor.py        # environment, deps, sources, live tests, safety behaviour
python3 tests/test_evidence_stack.py   # 22 unit tests, no network required
```

**Running locally is the simplest full unlock.** A personal machine has no egress
proxy, so every REST source works with no configuration and no security trade-off:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-local.sh      # pull, deps, tests, health check, next steps
```


- **Routing table, allowlist and troubleshooting:** [`references/EVIDENCE-SOURCE-ROUTING.md`](references/EVIDENCE-SOURCE-ROUTING.md)
- **Shared helper for scripts:** [`scripts/evidence_net.py`](scripts/evidence_net.py) —
  classifies a failed request as *policy-blocked* / *infrastructure error* /
  *source responded with an error*, and names the MCP tool to use instead.
- **Retraction checking, full offline dataset:** [`tools/tai_retraction_watch.py`](tools/tai_retraction_watch.py) —
  downloads the Crossref-hosted Retraction Watch registry and indexes it locally, so
  `retraction_check.py local <file>` gives a complete verdict with no network and no
  index gaps. Requires reaching Crossref, so run it on a personal machine.
- **Retraction checking without network:** [`scripts/retraction_check.py`](scripts/retraction_check.py) —
  extracts DOIs, then turns a Scite `editorialNotices` response into a verdict table
  (retracted / concern / correction / clean / **not checked**). Verified against
  Mehra 2020 and Wakefield 1998. Removes the need to allowlist Crossref for this.

### ⚠️ Safety rule: "source unreachable" ≠ "no evidence"

A lookup script that swallows a network error and returns an empty list reads
downstream as *"searched, found nothing"* — which invites filling the gap with
generated content. In a medical tool that means fabricated citations.

Every evidence skill here must therefore:

1. **Fail loudly.** Report unreachable sources; never return empty results as if the
   lookup succeeded.
2. **Never invent** PMIDs, DOIs, titles or figures to fill a gap.
3. **Report three distinct states:** `verified` · `could not verify (reason)` · `verified as wrong`.
4. **Never** disable TLS verification, unset `HTTPS_PROXY`, or route around the policy.
